# Issues
- I had a good bit of issues with this assignment. I had a very hard time remembering how to use flexbox and other styling tools and had the hardest time figuring out how to complete the banner overlay.
- I had a lot of issues with spacing and the box model. It seemed that all my objects were being alligned to the left and it made the objects hard to see.
- I also have issues with centering images both vertically and horizontally but that was mainly due to not remembering flexbox as well as I had hoped.
